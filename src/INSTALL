To compile on UNIX/MacOS, make sure you have the
program `make` and a C compiler (e.g. `gcc`) 
installed, then type:

    make

Then move the generated binary file (`mrmodeltest2`)
to somewhere in your PATH. 

For use on MS Windows, invoke make with the `win`
argument when compiling (on a MS Windows OS compile
system. I've used `MinGW` in the past):

    make win
