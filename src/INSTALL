To compile on UNIX/Mac OS X/Mac OS/ MS Windows, make 
sure you have the program `make` and a C compiler 
(e.g. `gcc`) installed, then type:

    make

Then move the generated binary file (`mrmodeltest2`)
to somewhere in your PATH. 

For use on MS Windows, invoke make with the `win`
argument when compiling (on a MS Windows OS compile
system. I've used `MinGW` in the past):

    make win
